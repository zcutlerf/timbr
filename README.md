CreateDB.sql is the sql script. This will create the database.

To run it, type: 
mysql -uroot -ptimbrcity < CreateDB.sql into the command line. 

The most current version of our model is called tree_model_1.mwb. 
After you change tree_model_1.mwb, do this to overwrite changes:
file -> export -> forward Engineer sql create script and save as same script name.

The php works with default values.
